StatsMixNetLibrary
==================

A C# dll library for the StatsMix Service

This works with teh StatsMix site: http://www.statsmix.com/

I needed a library that provided a dll because for some projects we are still using VS 2008, which does not support NuGet

I also made some changes to the code to support async calls and added some new overloads

See the StatsMixNetLibrary2 if you need to support .Net 2.0.
